                                 ************************************

Liquid:   Oil

          Behaves like Water/Lava in how it flows.  Oil "floats" on Water - the block rises
          to the top of Water Blocks.  When you have Oil on you, it is on you for (X) time
          amount, and if you go near Fire or Lava, you get on fire and cannot be put out by Water.
          The fire goes out when you die or when the Oil time runs out.

          Oil is deep underground in a 4x4 square.

Mobs:     Bees, Queen Bee

          Eating honey restores 1 & 1/2 hearts and cures poison.
          
Items:    Stinger (weapon)

          A Beehive is a randomly-generated structure; it contains Honey Hexes, Honeycombs,
          and a few Honey Blocks.  Bees live inside the hive, protecting a chamber around
          the Queen, who generates more Bees.  If you mine any blocks or attack any Bees,
          all the Bees will attack you.  The Stingers cause poison as well as damage.

          Beehives tend to spawn in areas with lots of Flowers (Flower Field, Flower Forest)

          If you put on a yellow dyed shirt, black dyed pants, and hold the Stinger in your
          offhand, you can go into a Beehive and not be attacked, even if you mine the blocks.

Crafting: 6 Stingers + 1 Shield = Pointed Shield

Armor:    Pointed Shield:  This will both protect you and posion anyone attacking you

          Pollen is used as bone meal would be, but only effects flowers, making the
          flower you use it on duplicate itself x2

          A Stinger is used as an offhand weapon that is passive.  If you are attacked,
          the mob attacking you receives damage.

          Stingers cannot be enchanted, but are counted as a weapon.

          On Pistons, they act like Slime Blocks in their sticking ability,
          but have no bounce effect.

Brewing:  Adding Silvery Beet to a Mundane Potion makes it a Defense Potion
          Adding Copppery Beet to a Mundane Potion makes it a Resist Potion
          Adding Irony Beet to a Strange Potion makes it an Unhunger Potion
          (restores food over time/cancels hunger effect)

Armor:    Emerald
          The armor has a durability lower than iron, but slightly higher defense.

Weapons:  Emerald
          Slightly higher strength than gold, lower than iron.  They last as long
          as stone tools.  

Armor:    Copper
          The armor has a durability higher than iron, but less defense.

Weapons:  Copper
          Lower strength than iron, higher durability than iron, lasts as long as iron tools.

Armor:    Silver
          The armor has a durability equal to diamond, but less defense.

Weapons:  Silver 
          Higher strength than iron, but not as high as diamond; durability equal to diamond tools.

          Marrow is 4x more effective than bone meal; same effect, just x4
          Magical Dust + any item in anvil will give that item a random enchantment.
          Nitroglycerin is 2x more powerful than TNT.

Plants:   Corn Stalk

          Vines need 1 fence to grow up on. Will grow across/up fences that are connected to each other.

          Placing Gourd Blocks in a square shape 4x4 and then lighting it with fire will make a portal.
          If you step into the portal, it will change day to night or night to day.

          Feed a wolf a Kiwi and it turns into Kiwi from Code Lyoko :D/

Blocks:   * Clay Wall
          * New Beacon
          Flower Bed Block

Items:    Glowing Water Bucket

Block:    Gateblock its a new crafting table, it looks like a circuit.

          on it you put redstone dust, repeaters, redstone torches, redstone comparators
          and redstone blocks.  You put them on in whatever configuration to get gates.

		  and / or / nor / nand

          grass block = flower bed?

          There are three slots in the GUI - the left and right slot are ones you
          put in items; the center is where they combine and you collect the result.
          Things it combines:

          Glass Block/Diamond = Crystal Shard
          Crystal Block/Redstone Block = Powered Crystal Block
          Dirt/Bucket of Water = Podsol
          Clay Pot/Clay Pot = Clay Wall Block
          Magma Block/Netherrack  Block = Hellstone Block
          String/Slimeball = Spider Web
          Bucket of Water/Glowstone Block = Glowing Water Bucket

          New Beacon you can place whatever direction you want & doesn't care if something
          solid is above it (or below etc).

          Clay Wall, when put in a Furnace, cooks into Flower-bed Block.  If you place them
          surrounding dirt blocks, it's a Flower Bed - Flower Bed see whatever flowers are
          put there and "grow" more of the same flower - so you can make more (X) type of
          flowers easily.
